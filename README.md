# II_Data_Structures_Seminar
3rd Semester Project

**Project Name:** SHEIN Simulator

**Description:**
The "SHEIN-Style Fashion Store Simulator" is a terminal-based program developed as part of the Seminar on Problem Solving in Data Structures II. This project aims to simulate the operation of an online fashion store, drawing inspiration from the popular e-commerce website SHEIN.

**Key Features:**

1. **Product Catalog:** The program enables users to navigate a catalog of fashion products, including clothing, accessories, and more. Each product is represented by a class containing detailed information such as name, description, price, available sizes, and more.

2. **Shopping Cart:** Users can select products and add them to their shopping cart. The program keeps track of items in the cart, calculates the total purchase amount, and enables users to manage their selection before completing the purchase.

3. **User Management:** An authentication and user management system is implemented, allowing customers to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. Registered users can also access their purchase history.

4. **Payment Processing:** The program simulates the online payment process, including entering credit card information and confirming the purchase.

5. **Inventory and Stock:** Inventory of products is tracked and updated in real-time as customers make purchases.

6. **Classes, Data Structures, Trees, and Graphs:** The project extensively utilizes data structures such as classes for product representation, lists for cart management, as well as trees and graphs for various functionalities.

**Project Objectives:**
- Apply the concepts and techniques learned in the Seminar on Problem Solving in Data Structures II to a practical project.
- Develop skills in object-oriented programming and software design.
- Simulate the operation of an online fashion store, including user interaction, inventory tracking, and payment processing.

**Additional Requirements:**
- The project is entirely terminal-based; there is no graphical user interface.
- Clear documentation and code comments are expected to facilitate understanding and maintenance.
- The user interface in the terminal should be intuitive and user-friendly for customers.

**Note:**
The project goes beyond a graphical interface and includes file handling, data compression and decompression, as well as the implementation of trees and graphs for specific functionalitiesâ€”all within the terminal environment.
